# Console CRUD app
**Implement a console CRUD application that has the following entities:**

- Developer
   - id
   - firstName 
   - lastName 
   - List<Skill> skills
   - Specialty specialty
- Skill
- Specialty
- Status (ACTIVE, DELETED)

The user in the console should be able to create, read, edit, and delete data.

To run locally, you will need a MySQL server, as well as enter your login and password to connect =)
